# Extracting Meaning from Natural Language with the Language Understanding Service (LUIS) on Microsoft Azure

## Overview

:)

## What is LUIS?

A Machine learning-based service (hosted on Microsoft Azure) to build natural language into apps, bots and IoT devices.

LUIS allows us to quickly create enterprise-ready natural language models that continuously improve.

It is design to identify valuable information in conversations and gives developers the power to integrate those conversations into their apps and bots.

*Why use LUIS?*
    1. Simple to use. It uses a technology called active learning.=> Always learning and improving.
    2. Allow developers to quickly build a custom language solution with less lines of code.
    3. Hosted on MIcrosoft Azure -> meaning secure and highly scalable.  As your solution grows, so will LUIS
    4. LUIS is enterprise ready. It supports 13 languages and plays nicely with other Azure services.

## LUIS fundamentals

LUIS -> Language Understanding Intelligent Service

LUIS is a service design to enhance your apps to better understand *natural language processing*.

LUIS uses a technology of _interactive machine learning_.

Essentially what happens acts as a translator by taking user requests and transforming them into actions for your application.

Value of LUIS:

  - Just like web apps, coversational apps rely on Controllers to route the incoming requests to the right response.
    For all incoming messages, the app intercepts them and send them off to a controller. Say that the message contains a the word secret, and you have a SecretController. If the user types private or confidential, you would need to add more logic to tell your app that Secret could be a "the same" as private or confidential.

  - The more words, the more complex a controller's logic becomes, to process that input and provide the correct response. => This is where LUIS comes to the rescue.

  LUIS can understand different words, that we can call intents, and route secret to the correct response.

  LUIS can route the different inputs where they need to go. e.g. Secret, Private or Confidential.

  LUIS moves complexity and unnecessary logic from the application layer.

## Entities (entidades)

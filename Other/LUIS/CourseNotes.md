## What is LUIS

A Machine learning-based service (hosted on Microsoft Azure) to build natural language into apps, bots and IoT devices.

LUIS allows us to quickly create enterprise-ready natural language models that continuously improve.

It is design to identify valuable information in conversations and gives developers the power to integrate those conversations into their apps and bots.

*Why use LUIS?*
    1. Simple to use. It uses a technology called active learning.=> Always learning and improving.
    2. Allow developers to quickly build a custom language solution with less lines of code.
    3. Hosted on MIcrosoft Azure -> meaning secure and highly scalable.  As your solution grows, so will LUIS
    4. LUIS is enterprise ready. It supports 13 languages and plays nicely with other Azure services.

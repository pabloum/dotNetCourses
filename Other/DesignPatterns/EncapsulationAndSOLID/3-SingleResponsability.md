# SOLID


## Single Responsability Principle

"A class should have one and only one reason to change"

In other words, one should gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons.

Generally, we should structure our code in such a way that changes should be requested by only one person.

Example:
    Reasons to change:
    1. UI Design Engineer
    2. Software Architect
    3. Legal Advisor



### Introduction and Motivation

SOLID is not a framework not a library
It is not technology bound
It is not a Pattern
It is for object-oriented

SOLID is not a goal, because you can't measure the degree of SOLIDness of a code base

There are a lot of ways in which you can approach SOLIDness. And actually you will approach it asymptotically.

Object-oriented design. Using these principles could lead you to a more Object-oriented design. Currently, even if you use object oriented languages, the codes tend to be very procedural.

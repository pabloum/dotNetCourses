# SOLID


## Single Responsability Principle

"A class should have one and only one reason to change"

In other words, one should gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons.

Generally, we should structure our code in such a way that changes should be requested by only one person.

Example:
    Reasons to change:
    1. UI Design Engineer
    2. Software Architect
    3. Legal Advisor

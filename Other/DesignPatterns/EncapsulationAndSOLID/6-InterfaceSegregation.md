## Interface segregation Principle

The clients shouldn’t be forced to implement the methods that they do not use.

"The interface segregation principle (ISP) is about creating very specialized interfaces for the client. It’s a good practice to create interfaces that are understandable from the perspective of the client. The Interface segregation principle encourages us to create different interfaces for different clients. The clients mentioned above are nothing but the classes implementing them"

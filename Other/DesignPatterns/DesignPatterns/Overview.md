# Design Patterns Overview

## Introduction

-> "A pattern is a recurring solution to a problem in a context"

-> "reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context"

-> "Design Patterns in the object-oriented world is a reusable solution to common software design problems that occur repeatedly in real-world application development. It is a template or description of how to solve problems that can be used in many situations"

There are 23 design patterns, also known as Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns. The Gang of Four is the authors of the book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". These 23 patterns are grouped into three main categories:

- Creational patterns -> Creational Design Patterns provide ways to instantiate a single object or group of related objects
    1. Factory Method   ----
    2. Abstract Factory
    3. Builder     -----
    4. Prototype
    5. Singleton    ---

- Structural patterns -> are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality
    1. Adapter        ------
    2. Bridge
    3. Composite
    4. Decorator        ----
    5. FaÃ§ade
    6. Flyweight
    7. Proxy          ------

- Behavioral patterns -> "are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns" or "it defines the manner to communicate between classes and object"
    1. Chain of Responsibility   ------
    2. Command        ----
    3. Interpreter
    4. Iterator
    5. Mediator
    6. Memento        -----
    7. Observer       -----
    8. State
    9. Strategy
    10. Visitor
    11. Template Method

## 2. LINQ and C#.

### The power of IEnumerable

Extension methods and Lambdas -> important for using LINQ

Remember that LINQ is designed to work against different kinds of data sources, e.g. in memory data or database

In order to perform LINQ operations, the data we are using must implement `IEnumerable<T>` interface

`Employee[] developers;`
`List<Employee> tester;`
This 2 collection types implement the `IEnumerable<T>`, so we may use linq

```
// Employee[] developers = new Employee[]
IEnumerable<Employee> developers = new Employee[]
{
    new Employee { Id = 1, Name = "Pablo" },
    new Employee { Id = 2, Name = "Vasco" }
};

// List<Employee> testers = new List<Employee>
IEnumerable<Employee> testers = new List<Employee>
{
    new Employee { Id = 3, Name = "Jos√©" },
    new Employee { Id = 4, Name = "Nati" }
};

// IEnumerator<Employee> enumerator = developers.LINQ_QUERY_OPERATORS();
IEnumerator<Employee> enumerator = developers.GetEnumerator();
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
    LOG(enumerator.Current.Name);
}
```

LINQ does not work with normal methods, where you just add functionalities like orderby or filter where.
*LINQ works by using extension methods* --> Ganz wichtig

IEnumerable<T> perfect for hiding the source of data. It is just an interface.

*Extension methods*: They allow to implement functionality against an interface or any type definition without changing the underlying type --dafaq--

We don't want to implement all the LINQ operations as methods in IEnumerable. That would break it all. We don't want that. We just need to extend its functionality.


### Creating an extension method

Allow us to define a static method that appears to be a member of another type. Any type: classes, interfaces, structs, even *sealed* types that we can't extend using inheritance.

** Extension method must be defined in a non-generic static class.

`static public double MyExtensionMethod(this string data)` -> `this` tells the compiler, that the method is an extension method.

We can have as many parameters as we wish, but only the first one need the `this` modifier.

The type of the first parameter is important because that's the type that I'm targeting to extend with this particular method.
  * In other words, I want MyExtensionMethod to appear as an instance method on a `string` type.

e.g.
```
string m_str = "45.676";
m_str.MyExtensionMethod();
```
Behind the scenes: Just calling the static method I created, but this is useful, because the syntax is much easier to read.

LINQ uses a lot extension methods to extend interfaces like IEnumerable<T>. And all the other LINW query operators, the operators that can  filter and sort and aggregate, they are all defined as extension methods.

I cannot re-implement, replace or method which is already an instance method on an object

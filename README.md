This repo contains all my personal notes and examples for the Dot Net courses that I've made.

Until 08/3113/2020, all of them were Pluralsight courses.

Some of the courses you can find here:

  * ASP.Net Core Fundamentals
  * Build APIs with ASP.Net Core
  * Entity Framework Core
  * LINQ Fundamentals
